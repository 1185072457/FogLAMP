FogLAMP North Plugins
=====================

FogLAMP North Plugins are the code modules that are used by the northbound
process within FogLAMP to send data upwards to historian, the cloud
or the FOG layer. The plugins each implement specific protocols and/or
format conversions required for a particular destination service.

Generic processing for the northbound processing is implemented in the
FogLAMP north modules.
